## About My Project

My project aims to detect cyberattacks on autonomous navigation systems. We focus on identifying potential threats and creating methods to prevent them. Using cybersecurity techniques and machine learning, we work to ensure the safety and reliability of autonomous vehicles. Our goal is to develop effective ways to stop these attacks. This will help build trust in the use of autonomous vehicles. Overall, we aim to make these systems safer for everyone.
