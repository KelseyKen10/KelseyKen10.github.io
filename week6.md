Today, I was followed around with a camera all day, continued to work on my mid-summer symposium slides, and continued to work on my machine learning model. I also had a meeting with Dr. Pandey and Dr. Cole to go over what was expected for Wednesday and updates on our projects.

Today, I started the preprocessing phase of my project. I first downloaded my datasets in Ubuntu and cleaned it through Ubuntu Terminal. After this I tried implementing the data set into Visual Studio but realised I could not upload it through here becasue the csv file could contain a virus. I waited then told by my graduate mentor to wait until our faculty professor came. In the mean time I researched about the different classifiers in my research paper.
