**Monday June 3 2024**
Today, I attended a writing seminar that focused on how to formulate a research paper. I learned that in research, it is essential to back up all claims and statements with solid evidence; being wrong without evidence is unacceptable. After the seminar, I spent time in my research lab reading papers on cyber attacks on navigation systems. This furthered my understanding of the vulnerabilities and threats in this critical area of technology.

Today, I read and analyzed research papers, taking notes and categorizing them into five areas: Data, Processing, Machine Learning Model, Classifier, and Control. I also worked on my CITI training and had a meeting with Dr. Cole, who updated us on additional tasks and learning objectives.

**Wednesday June 5 2024**
Today, I completed reading the research papers and took detailed notes. Additionally, I started working on my presentation for Dr. Cole, which is scheduled for tomorrow.
