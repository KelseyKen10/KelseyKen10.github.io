**Monday June 3 2024**
Today, I attended a writing seminar that focused on how to formulate a research paper. I learned that in research, it is essential to back up all claims and statements with solid evidence; being wrong without evidence is unacceptable. After the seminar, I spent time in my research lab reading papers on cyber attacks on navigation systems. This furthered my understanding of the vulnerabilities and threats in this critical area of technology.

Today, I read and analyzed research papers, taking notes and categorizing them into five areas: Data, Processing, Machine Learning Model, Classifier, and Control. I also worked on my CITI training and had a meeting with Dr. Cole, who updated us on additional tasks and learning objectives.

**Wednesday June 5 2024**
Today, I completed reading the research papers and took detailed notes. Additionally, I started working on my presentation for Dr. Cole, which is scheduled for tomorrow.


**Thursday June 6 2024**
Today, I completed working on the slides that Dr. Cole instructed me to finish. I also had a meeting with Dr. Cole, my mentor Mr. Zaman, and Professor Pandey. During the meeting, we discussed tasks for the next two weeks and reviewed the research papers. Dr. Cole also demonstrated how to break down the readings into five sections. Additionally, I went over my notes for the two research papers I had completed reading.
