 Today, I continued to analyze my research paper. With this I found the datasets within the paper and was able to read about the preprocessing cleaning process. I also finished installing Cuckoo Sandbox.

Today, I had a meeting with Dr. Cole and the rest of my team where we talked about what data sets we've found and how far we have come along in our indivual projects. During this meeting I woudld say, there was a lack of communication. We were all told one thing by our faculty member last week, but today we were told that we didnt need to work on it.

Today, I started the preprocessing phase of my project. I first downloaded my datasets in Ubuntu and cleaned it through Ubuntu Terminal. After this I tried implementing the data set into Visual Studio but realised I could not upload it through here becasue the csv file could contain a virus. I waited then told by my graduate mentor to wait until our faculty professor came. In the mean time I researched about the different classifiers in my research paper.
