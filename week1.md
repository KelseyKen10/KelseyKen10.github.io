This week, I made significant strides in my learning journey. I learned the basics of Git and computer science, gaining a better understanding of version control and computing principles. Mastering type casting was a key achievement. I realized that Machine Learning is essentially the brain of Artificial Intelligence, deepening my appreciation for AI’s complexity. I also learned about logistic regression, an important algorithm for classification problems in Machine Learning.

However, I faced challenges with the fast pace of the Numpy/Matplotlib lessons. To overcome this, I’m reviewing the material independently to ensure I fully understand it. Despite these challenges, the first week was great. The steep learning curve was worth it because of the knowledge and skills I gained. I’m excited to continue this journey and learn more in the coming weeks.
